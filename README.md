# Alpaca or Not Alpaca Classifier

In this project, we'll be using transfer learning on a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to build an Alpaca/Not Alpaca classifier.

A pre-trained model is a network that's already been trained on a large dataset and saved, which allows us to use it to customize our model cheaply and efficiently. The model we'll be using, MobileNetV2, was designed to provide fast and computationally efficient performance. It's been pre-trained on ImageNet, a dataset containing over 14 million images and 1000 classes.
